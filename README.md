This repository shows our final project of the Advanced Data Analytics Bootcamp at neuefische GmbH:  
# Juvenile crime in Germany - current extent, distribution, and development
In this README file, you find an introduction to the topic and a description on the fictitious scenario that served us as assigned task. Furthermore, the scope, the sources and the tools used, are described. <br> <br> 
If you would like to go directly to the final outcome/result(?), click on this link: https://crime-germany.streamlit.app/ - it redirects you to the dashboard that provides at-a-glance views on the current extent, distribution, and recent development of juvenile crime in Germany and its 16 federal states.<br>


## What is juvenile crime?
In Germany, offences committed by persons aged between 14 and 20 are classified as juvenile crime.

## Scenario (Fictive)
While the implementation competence of preventive action against juvenile crime lies with the 16 federal states of Germany, the research on prevention and the development of preventive strategies is taken over by social science research institutes. Germany is involved in this process in the role of the Bundesministerium f√ºr Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend. The BMFSFJ is responsible for stimulating action in the 16 federal states and for allocating funds on research.  

In order to be able to optimally fulfill its competences to stimulate adequate action and to distribute funds appropriately, the BMFSFJ assigned us to provide them with a comprehensive overview of the current extent of juvenile crime in Germany.

They would like to know the current level of juvenile crime, the development over the recent years, the offenses that account for the majority of juvenile crime, and the distribution of the most common offenses.
